This is a small scientice project about path build problem in graf.

I have implemented two search algorithms: A star search and breadth first search.

Run main method in class Test to start the project.

Change the comments of the "Navigator navi" to select a search algorithm.

Change the size of map and percentage of barriers in the method PathUtils.makeMap().

The PathUtils.printMap() method will show the map with the created path.
